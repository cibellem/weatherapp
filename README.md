# weatherapp



### Description

This is a Weather Dashboard built using OpenWeather API. The application shows today's weather and a 5 days forecast. For the 5 days forecast and for the UV index I made two extra AJAX calls. The application also displays an icon representation of the actual weather. When the app is seen in a small screen I choose to not display the recent searches to provide a better user experience. This feature is available only in large screens.
